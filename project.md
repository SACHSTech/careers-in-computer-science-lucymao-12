 A study of the fundamental principles of atomic structure, radiation and nuclear chemistry, valence theory, coordination chemistry, and the periodic table.

 <br>

 ## Post First Year
This degree is a specialization within the broad Bachelor's of Science Physical, Earth, Math, an Computer Science group. Within first year there are a certain group of courses that need to be taken as mentioned above but as you enter into your second year and beyond you can begin to specialize your courses to work towards a certain major, we will be focusing on how one might obtain a Computer Science degree through this program.

A software engineering major requires the completion of 63 credits with a fair number of required courses within the School of Computer Science.

Here are a few examples:

* [COMP 202 Foundations of Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-202)  
Introduction to computer programming in a high level language: variables, expressions, primitive types, methods, conditionals, loops. Introduction to algorithms, data structures (arrays, strings), modular software design, libraries, file input/output, debugging, exception handling.

* [COMP 529 Software Architecture](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-529)  
Development, analysis, and maintenance of software architectures, with special focus on modular decomposition and reverse engineering.

* [COMP 303 Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-303)  
Principles, mechanisms, techniques, and tools for object-oriented software design and its implementation, including encapsulation, design patterns, and unit testing.

## How Long does it Take to Finish a Degree?

As stated before this degree requires you to take 63 credits within the specified program and school (this does not inculde first year). Depending on your high school diploma and any advanced university credits you might have earned in high school (through IB, AP classes, CEGEP) you can finish within 3-4 years.

<br>

# Experiential Learning
A software engineer needs more than just a good education to succeed within this field. This industry requires a dedication to the craft much like any other professional job, which means that individuals must take it upon themselves to enrich their own experience in ways outside of academia. Here I will be listing some of the many ways that you can develop yourself more within software engineering that a diploma might not be able to provide.

<br>

## Clubs and Councils
Clubs and councils are a great way to both network with individuals both within you field and with those outside of your field. They offer opportunities to work with teams towards common goals and give you valuable skills and experiences that you would not be able to obtain otherwise. These clubs and councils don't just need to pertain to your major, sometimes joining one that is completely unrelated to what you are studying can lead you to learn things you might not even have thought about.

Here are a few examples of clubs that you can join (or better yet, create): 
* Robotics Club

* Cardboard Boat Racing
* Solar Car Racing
* Women in Engineering
* Engineers without Borders


<br>

## Conferences and Competitions
Competitions are another way that aspiring engineers can both test out the skills that they have picked up in school while also learning new things during the event. Many competitions will not even require the individual to have any programming experience so it can be a fun way to delve into the community and learn the intricacies to this discipline.

Here are examples of some [competitions hosted by McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/connect/clubs-groups-teams#Competitions-Conferences):
* [McMaster Engineering Competition](https://www.facebook.com/MacEngComp/)

* [McMaster Designathon](https://www.mcmasterdesignleague.com/cad-designathon)
* [DeltaHacks Hackathon](https://www.deltahacks.com/)
* [The Forge Student Startup Competition](https://theforge.mcmaster.ca/)


Conferences are also a great way for people to network and build connections. They allow studetns and professionals to share knowledge and learn off of one another. By attending conferences people are opened up to different facets of the world that a classroom cannot possibly be capable of. Oftentimes, conferences invite experts from all over the globe to speak and present their own original views and reaserch.

Here are some examples of [conferences held by McMaster University](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/connect/clubs-groups-teams#Competitions-Conferences):

* First Year Experiential Conference

* Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference
* Canadian Chemical Engineering Conference
* Conference on Sustainability in Engineering

## Personal Projects
Personal projects are a great way to show potential employers that you are capable of taking the theory that you have learned and applying it in ways that are practical. Personal projects require a certain amount of discipline and self-regulation that will be very important in any professional job that you might want to apply. It can also give potential employers a good reflection of your skillset and you creative capabilities.

Here are a examples of projects that you can undertake:
<br>

* Creating an App

* Building a Website 
* Run your own Coding Class
* Making a Computer Game



# Real Jobs
At the end of the day, this degree will give you multiple options going forward. Getting a job within this industry is one of the many choices available to you within this field. These are some results that were pulled from the internet. This chart and subsequent bodies of text can give you a little bit of information on what you can expect while job hunting within the software engineering industry.
