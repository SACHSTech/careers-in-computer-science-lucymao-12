# Software Engineer
Software engineers apply their computer science and programming knowledge in very practical ways within society. They are responsible for programs, websites, search engines, and operating systems that run almost all pieces of techonology we use today. Join me as we dive a little deeper into what it takes to become a software engineer.

## Certifications
 Canadian institutions have many accredited programs that give students the tools to succeed as a software engineer in the real world.
* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
* Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering

* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Systems Engineering
* College Computer Science Programs
* And much More... **might also be a link**

Depending on the job there might be other certifications that an engineer must obtain to work. This inculdes passing a practical examination or applying for a
[license.](https://www.peo.on.ca/)

## Technical Skills
Creating software is a very intricate and difficult process so people must be equipped with the right set of skills to succeed within this field.
* Practical Proficiency in Programming Langauges

* Testing and Debugging Software
* Information Analysis
* Knowledge in Design and Architecture
* Knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures
* Ability to Communicate Techinal Information to both Technical and Non-Technical Staff Members

<br>

## Non-technical Skills
A strong foundation in programming and computer science is a good start, but software engineers will require other skills as well to flourish within this field. The projects that come with this career are often big enough to require a team of people to complete and that means that engineers must be willing and comfortable with working with other individuals both creatively and professionally. Additionally, this career will teach you on the job so candidates must be willing to learn, and learn quickly within an ever-changing, techologically-driven world.

* Ability to Create and Maintain Schedules

* Staying Up to Date with Current Trends, Technologies, Techniques, Etc
* Resourceful, Adaptable, and Flexible
* Communication and Interpersonal Skills

## Salary Range
The salary of a software engineer is oftentimes higher than the average salaray for many other industries. This coupled with the fact that people within this career find themselves with steady linear salary growth corresponding with the number of years they have within the field makes this a highly ranked job.

Here is the average breakdown for a software engineer:
>**Base** &#8594; 54K-102K  
>**Bonus** &#8594; 1K-12K  
>**Total** &#8594; 52K-109K

<br>

# Standard Education
This part will vary from individual to individual so do not be concerned because this is only one of a multitude of paths one can take to find a career within software engineering.

McGill is one of the leading reasearch institutions in Canada that houses some of the top reaserachers in the world. We will be focusing on the Bachelor's of science in computer science degree that can be obtained through this institution from the high school pre-requisites all the way to the completion of the diploma. With this diploma, alumni are afforded many different job opportunities within the software engineering industry.

<br>

## Pre First Year
Pre-Requesite High School Courses
* 4U English or French

* 4U Calculus and Vectors
* Two of 4U Biology, Chemistry, or Physics

Mark Requirements
* 92% Minimum Average

* 87% and Above for all Pre-Requisite Courses

<br>

## First Year

Here are a few first year courses that students must take:
* [Math 140 Calculus 1](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/math-140)  
Review of functions, graphs. Limits, continuitity, derivative. Differentiation of elementary functions. Antidifferentiation.

* [Math 141 Calculus 2](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/math-141)  
The definite integral. Techniques of intergration. Introduction to sequences and series.

* [Phys 101 Introductory Phsyics - Mechanics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/phys-101)  
 An introductory course in physics without calculus, covering mechanics (kinematics, dynamics, energy, and rotational motion), oscillations and waves, sound, light, and wave optics.

 * [PHYS 102 Introductory Physics - Electromagnetism](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/phys-102)  
 Electric field and potential. D.C. circuits and measurements. Capacitance. Magnetic field and induction. Electromagnetic waves and geometrical optics.

 <br>

 ## Post First Year
This degree is a specialization within the broad Bachelor's of Science Physical, Earth, Math, an Computer Science group. Within first year there are a certain group of courses that need to be taken as mentioned above but as you enter into your second year and beyond you can begin to specialize your courses to work towards a certain major, we will be focusing on how one might obtain a Computer Science degree through this program.

A computer science major requires the completion of 63 credits with a fair number of required courses within the School of Computer Science.

Here are a few examples:

* [COMP 202 Foundations of Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-202)  
Introduction to computer programming in a high level language: variables, expressions, primitive types, methods, conditionals, loops. Introduction to algorithms, data structures (arrays, strings), modular software design, libraries, file input/output, debugging, exception handling.

* [COMP 251 Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-251)  
Introduction to algorithm design and analysis. Graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, maximum flows.

* [COMP 303 Software Design](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-303)  
Principles, mechanisms, techniques, and tools for object-oriented software design and its implementation, including encapsulation, design patterns, and unit testing.

## How Long does it Take to Finish a Degree?

As stated before this degree requires you to take 63 credits within the specified program and school (this does not inculde first year). Each course varies from 3 credits to 4 credits per course. The maximum amount of credits one can earn within a semester is 17 which means that theoretically one can finish a degree in computer science in three years, although normally this would be a four year degree with a lighter course load.
