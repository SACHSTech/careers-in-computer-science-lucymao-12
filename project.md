# Software Engineer
Software engineers apply their computer science and programming knowledge in very practical ways within society. They are responsible for programs, websites, search engines, and operating systems that run almost all pieces of techonology we use today. Join me as we dive a little deeper into what it takes to become a software engineer.

## Certifications
 Canadian institutions have many accredited programs that give students the tools to succeed as a software engineer in the real world.
* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
* Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering

* Bachelor's Degree in Computer Systems Engineering
* College Computer Science Programs
* And much More... **might also be a link**

Depending on the job there might be other certifications that an engineer must obtain to work. This inculdes passing a practical examination or applying for a

## Technical Skills
Creating software is a very intricate and difficult process so people must be equipped with the right set of skills to succeed within this field.
* Practical Proficiency in Programming Langauges

* Testing and Debugging Software
* Information Analysis
* Knowledge in Design and Architecture
* Knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures

<br>

## Non-technical Skills
A strong foundation in programming and computer science is a good start, but software engineers will require other skills as well to flourish within this field. The projects that come with this career are often big enough to require a team of people to complete and that means that engineers must be willing and comfortable with working with other individuals both creatively and professionally. Additionally, this career will teach you on the job so candidates must be willing to learn, and learn quickly within an ever-changing, techologically-driven world.

* Ability to Create and Maintain Schedules

* Staying Up to Date with Current Trends, Technologies, Techniques, Etc
* Resourceful, Adaptable, and Flexible
* Communication and Interpersonal Skills

## Salary Range
The salary of a software engineer is oftentimes higher than the average salaray for many other industries. This coupled with the fact that people within this career find themselves with steady linear salary growth corresponding with the number of years they have within the field makes this a highly ranked job.

Here is the average breakdown for a software engineer:
>**Base** &#8594; 54K-102K  
>**Bonus** &#8594; 1K-12K  
>**Total** &#8594; 52K-109K

# Standard Education
This part will vary from individual to individual so do not be concerned because this is only one of a multitude of paths one can take to find a career within software engineering.

McGill is one of the leading reasearch institutions in Canada that houses some of the top reaserachers in the world. We will be focusing on the Bachelor's of science in computer science degree that can be obtained through this institution from the high school pre-requisites all the way to the completion of the diploma. With this diploma, alumni are afforded many different job opportunities within the software engineering industry.
